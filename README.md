# Python for Earth scientists

Welcome to Python for Earth scientists. This repository will serve as a collection of useful material to get you going in Python. A series of *[notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)* and *scripts* that will allow you to develop your Python skills with a strong leaning to typical tasks required in hydrology/hydrogeology that will expediate some more mundane processes while at the same time creating a transparent and repeatable process for future reference. This collection of tutorials and examples of *Python scripts* will include but not be limited to: 

1. input/output
2. Timeseries data and analysis
1. data analysis
1. data filtering
1. statistical analysis
1. model building
1. plotting
3. building MODFLOW models with Flopy
5. running external executables
6. maths functions
7. image processing


Over time the above mentioned topics will be covered using example scripts as well as notebooks. Not sure what a script or notebook is ... you'll soon learn! 

Let's get started!

## Installing Python
To use Python and many of its packages, it is recommended to install the Anaconda distribution from continuum (use Python 2.7 as versions 3.x are still in development, and many packages donâ€™t support version 3.x yet, although this may change in the near future). 

This provides an excellent number of packages, particularly for scientific computing.

You can download a copy here:

***\# TODO: Talk to Flinders IT on how to streamline this process ***
***\# UPDATE: I spoke with IT and they will likely put a job through to allow installation of Anaconda from the main list of installable programs ***

For a lighter version you can install Miniconda and just add packages as you need them ... more on this later.

## Jupyter (ipython) notebooks

***[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)*** will be the primary platform for demonstrating Python on this repository. Click the link to learn more about notebooks.

## Git
You'll probably have noticed by now that you are on a Github page. We'll cover what this is and why it's useful at a later stage ... but if you just can't wait and want to jump in to the world of Git:

## Learning the basics more generally ... not specific to Earth sciences:
New to python? No worries. Through the various notebooks
I recommend the following to get you going: 

https://www.codecademy.com/learn 

If you have a little more time and want to learn things more thoroughly:

http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html 

and there is a plethora of information on the python website as well:

https://www.python.org/ 

One link that is focussed on the scientific computing side of things: 

http://www.scipy-lectures.org/

In fact, there is an abundance of really good (and some not so good) information on many sites. Going through the above will be a nice introduction to [very high-level programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high-level_programming_language) and help you to begin working in an Object Oriented Programming environment. It is important that you take the time to work through these introductions slowly and do all the exercises yourself. The value of programming cannot be stressed enough for those wanting to pursue modelling. The vast internet resources brings a huge advantage to programming with almost all problems having being dealt with in some form or another, with example codes given in online discussion forums such as http://stackoverflow.com/. There will never be one package that does everything for you and so it is necessary to be able to write scripts for processing data. It is also of value to have a basic understanding of a [high-level programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) language such as [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) or [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).
