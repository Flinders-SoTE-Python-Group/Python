#Starting with Python

## Installing
To use Python and many of its packages, it is recommended to install the Anaconda distribution from continuum (use Python 2.7 as versions 3.x are still in development, and many packages donâ€™t support version 3.x yet, although this may change in the near future). 

This provides an excellent number of packages, particularly for scientific computing.

## Learning the basics
New to python? I recommend the following to get you going:

If you have a little more time and want to learn things more thoroughly:

and there is a plethora of information on the python website as well:

Going through the above will be a nice introduction to very high-level programming and help you to begin working in an Object Oriented Programming environment. It is important that you take the time to work through these introductions slowly and do all the exercises yourself. The value of programming cannot be stressed enough for those wanting to pursue modelling. The vast internet resources brings a huge advantage to programming with almost all problems having being dealt with in some form or another, with example codes given in online discussion forums such as http://stackoverflow.com/. There will never be one package that does everything for you and so it is necessary to be able to write scripts for processing data. It is also of value to have a basic understanding of a high-level programming language such as Fortran or C++.
